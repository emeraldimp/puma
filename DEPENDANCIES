Puma depends on several other packages to function.  Some of these packages may have other dependancies not listed here.

Later versions than those listed may work, or may not.  Puma has been succesfully run on PHP 4 and 5 running on Apache and Lighttpd.

Smarty (2.6.14)                 http://smarty.php.net
